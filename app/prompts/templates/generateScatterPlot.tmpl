The following is a description of the DataFrame:
    ${description}

    Please provide a complete Python function that:
    1. Reads the CSV file from the given path.
    2. select columns for trend analysis - logically select the columns for the trend analysis they must be best suitable for the graphical representation as a Scatter Plot.(data should have x and y axes values)
    3. Extracts data for a single Scatter Plot based on the columns.
    4. Returns the data in the format: date,value.
    Ensure the code is syntactically correct and runnable in Python.
    call csv using the following path: "path_to_your_csv_file.csv"
    also call the funtion to execute it and data should be in a variable called "results"

Below is the SAMPLE value of the result variable, use it to only follow the structure
result = {
    chartName:".." # single name for chart x-axis vs y-axis 
    labels:['...', '...', '...',  ...] # Array of Strings (describes each element of dataset.data)
    dataset:[
        {
            x-axis:".." #should contain the data of the x axis for the chart 
            y-axis:".." #should contain the data of the y axis for the chart - y value should be having a numeric significance
        }, #can add more if needed for multi bar plot
    ]
    chartTitle:"..."
