The following is a description of the DataFrame:
${description}

Please provide a complete Python function that:
1. Reads the CSV file from the given path.
2. Select columns for trend analysis - logically select the columns for the trend analysis they must be best suitable for the graphical representation as a pie chart.(typically the coulmns diving the whole data in minimum parts are the accurate columns)
2. Extracts data based on the columns.
3. Returns the data in the format: label,value.
Ensure the code is syntactically correct and runnable in Python.
also call the funtion to execute it and data should be in a variable called "results"
call csv using the following path: "path_to_your_csv_file.csv"
Use descriptive statistics like sum, average(mean), etc if needed

Below is the SAMPLE value of the result variable, use it to only follow the structure
result = {
    labels:["...", "...", "...",  ...] # Array of String (describes each element of data)
    data:[13, 46, 67,  ...] # Array of numbers
    chartTitle:"..."
}
