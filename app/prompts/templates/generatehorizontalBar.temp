Below is the SAMPLE value of the result variable, use it to only follow the structure
result = {
     chartName:".." # single name for chart x-axis vs y-axis 
    labels:['...', '...', '...',  ...] # Array of Strings (describes each element of dataset.data)
    dataset:[
        {
            barLabel: "..." # Bar Description a single string describes the data in the data
            data: [13, 46, 67,  ...] # Array of numbers
        }, #can add more if needed for multi bar plot
    ]
    chartTitle:"..."
